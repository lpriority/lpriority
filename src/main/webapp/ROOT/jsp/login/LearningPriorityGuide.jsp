  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <p>Learning Priority is a privately held educational software design company, whose #1 priority is student learning. LP strives to help teachers, principals, school administrators and parents to develop their literacy and 21st century practices to meet students’ greatest challenges. </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6"><br>
        <p>LP has developed 21st Century Learning tools that engage learners’ communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity and caring. LP’s literacy tools focus on students’ Reading, Writing, Speaking, Math and media creation. LP literacy support enables educators to find the right balance of strategies and tools for each student’s learning context and achievement goals. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="images/Aboutus/LP/Picture1.PNG"></div>
    </div>
    <p>LP tools help teachers and schools craft the human/computer/human pathways that work best for the local and specific learning environments. In this sense, LP, Inc is a Learning Environment design team that crafts and adjusts software tools to meet the needs of the learner and organization. </p>

      <div class="col-sm-6"><br>
        <p>LP and RSD is a K-8 school district with nine schools and more than five thousand students. Together for the last seven years they have been developing and implementing software tools and school processes that aim to help children improve their learning while helping teachers, administrators and parents be more effective in supporting children’s learning. </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-7"><br>
        <p> Together they have been focused on strategies that maximize the human element in human to computer to human feedback systems. Many software systems have long aimed to create software solutions that are strictly human to computer. There is little empirical support for the overall effectiveness of these efforts to transform learning and teaching outcomes in significant ways. The LP/Rio partnership combines mutual interest, experience, and expertise in software and human systems designs that acknowledges that each school system, school, class is authentically different while also sharing common threads that can be connected in proper design and implementation processes. These processes begin and </p>

        <p> end by acknowledging the premise that teacher- student and student-student relationships are at the core of socially constructed learning while computers and software can serve to enhance these dynamics in multiple modes including making certain processes more efficient so that teachers and students can utilize their time together for deeper purposes. </p>
        <p>In Rio, the LP/Rio partnership has focused on Reading. This critical literacy is where Rio children and teachers had the initial greatest need. These efforts yielded two suites of applications in early literacy and fluency/meaning making. </p>

      <div class="col-sm-6"><br>
        <p>At the same time, the LP/Rio partnership designed tools to support 21st century learning practices. In Rio, these are the 5 Cs; Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, Creativity, and Caring. The applications developed serve to bring teachers, students, and parents into transformative contexts which better prepare and align with the demands of 21st century society and workplace. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6"><br>
        <p>The LP/Rio partnership has also developed a full online school administration system as well as math applications and a diverse set of assessment tools. Each design begins and ends with ongoing collaborations between educators and software designers. The partnership centers on software design and then quickly moves towards implementation and development. The partnership is a relationship. It itself is a design process. </p>

        <p> LP/Rio partnership is making a difference in the human development and organizational development associated with learning processes. This is a new model. It moves beyond the conventional software solution model that has struggled for years to significantly impact school system’s learning outcomes. This partnership model invests in humans and acknowledges that 21st century learning is human learning. It acknowledges the fact that many software applications have disconnected people. It works collaboratively to ask critical questions that delve into what we want computers and humans to do. </p>
